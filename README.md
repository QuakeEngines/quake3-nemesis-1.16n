Quake 3 1.16n Nemesis client mod

I've put this here as a placeholder while I consider releasing the source code for the Nemesis client mod. Please let me know if this is of interest to you by sending me a message ...

As the main website is no longer up, the original binaries are available to download from here. Download Nemesis-Client-v2.0.14_462.zip, follow the installation instructions, but use the latest client pk3, zzz-nemesis-client-2-0-14_529.pk3

There is no documentation for the superHUD as it was stored on the forum - while not lost, it's a pain to recover. Hopefully, anyone downloading Nemesis client after all these years already knows how to configure the superHUD themselves (or use one of the default configurations provided).
